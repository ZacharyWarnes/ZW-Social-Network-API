## **Description**

The ZW-Social-Network-API program is a mongoose based social-network application that allows the user to create, update, and delete USERS, FRIENDS, THOUGHTS, and REACTIONS. This is only a server-side functional application so no client facing code yet but possibly in the future. 

## **Installation**

To access and use this program: clone the repository to your local machine. Open the application in your preferred code editor. 


## **Usage Instructions**

Once the application is downloaded and opened in your code editor, make sure you run 'npm install' in the terminal to install all dev dependencies for this program to work properly. When this is done enter command "npm start" in your terminal to connect to the server. Now you can test routes in your preferred API program. Insomnia was used in the demo below.
